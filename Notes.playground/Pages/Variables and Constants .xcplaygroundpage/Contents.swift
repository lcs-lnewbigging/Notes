// A "Variable " is a place to store import Foundation
// We can find the "data type" for a variable by option-cliking the variable name
// This is a string data type
var greeting = "Hello, playground"
//This is a data type of INT, storage values like -7,0,15
var age = 15
//This is a Double, it stores numbers with decimal portions
var balance = 1229.34
//Constants are just like variable, but once set their value cannot change
let approximatelyPi = 3.14
//approximatelyPi = 4
